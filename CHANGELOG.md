### Changed

- Improve theme: font & background colors, element spacing, form styling, chart

### Added

- It is now possible to add new assets to the portfolio.
- It is now possible to enable/disable anchors on-the-fly for tethered assets
  that have multiple known anchors. The rebalancing algorithm will gradually
  move the funds to comply with the new setup in about 5~15 steps.
- Add the "remove" rebalancing mode to liquidate an asset and remove its
  trustlines.

### Changed

- Try to make an additional profit when an anchor for a tethered asset is out of
  balance.
- Up-to-date targets for demo portfolio.

### Fixed

  get generated in some cases.
- Raise up the number of fetched offers for orderbooks to fix an edge-case where
  price estimation for native assets other than Lumens would fail.

  to cancel.

### Fixed

- Portfolio pie chart: Fix cases that caused wrong positioning.
- Portfolio price chart: Make data for last day display properly (a timestamp
  issue caused weird roundings for crypto assets).
- Fix a bug that caused sell offers under 1XLM to pick absurdly high prices
  instead of being filtered out.

## 0.8.0 - 2019-05-17

### Added

- Rebalancing: Assets with multiple anchors whose are imbalanced now gets
  pro-actively rebalanced. This happens once the asset itself is balanced
  enough. This is done by little steps to mitigate the risks when only one of
  the two balancing trade is taken: anchorA to XLM or XLM to AnchorB.

### Changed

- Rebalancing: Native assets other than lumens don't use global market prices
  anymore, as those prices are not reliable due to market manipulations. This
  change affects valuation & price picking of: MOBI, REPO, RMT, SLT, TERN.
- Rebalancing: Anchors risk-balancing rules are now strictly applied when
  crafting transactions.
- Improve compliance with the [PWA] standard.
- Improve loading time.

## 0.7.0 - 2019-05-11

### Added

- Settings: 30 additional reference currencies (total: 33).

### Fixed

- Rebalancing: Being the quote currency, XLM cannot be in "ignore" mode.

## 0.6.1 - 2019-05-04

### Fixed

- Fix a mistake that prevented to select "Ignore" rebalancing mode.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-05-03

### Compatibility

This version comes with significant changes to the rebalancing targets
configuration. It will automatically convert your previous setup to the new
format. The first time you'll rebalance your portfolio, you'll have to
`[Save]` the converted configuration (which will lead to exactly the same
balance).

### Added

- New balancing mode "weight" that replaces "equal". Weight let you specify
  relative sizes for your positions. Once "percentage" & "quantity" targets have
  been allocated, the remaining funds are split between "weight" targets.
- New balancing mode "ignore".

### Changed

- Balancing mode "percentage" is now strictly applied. Before, it would act as
  "weight" in case unallocated funds remains − which could lead to a confusing
  user experience.
- Raise an error when total "percentage" targets are over hundred. Before, it
  would lower every target to get back to a valid sum − but this could lead to
  confusion as well.
- Remove Stronghold anchors from the trusted list. (Not active anymore)
- Rebalancing interface displays "Goal" according to rebalancing mode
  (weight/percentage/quantity/ignore).
- Rebalancing interface "Divergence" is now displayed relatively to portfolio
  total value.

### Fixed

- All overallocation/underallocation cases are now properly detected.
- Detect when an anchor order book is not tradable anymore.
- Rebalancing targets are now properly sorted after changes.
- Fix an inconsistency that would cause rebalance targets to be uselessly
  computed multiple times.
- Improve loading message spacing.

## 0.5.0 - 2019-04-19

### Added

- Logic for orders that need to take place over multiple anchors, such as
  position entries and exits.
- Equilibre.io will now tend to spread the position equally over asset multiple
  anchors.
- Apply price picking optimizations when rebalancing assets with quantity
  targets.
- Validity span of 5 minutes for transactions.
- Animate transaction signing frame.

### Fixed

- Fix background image of transaction signing frame.

## 0.4.5 - 2019-04-12

### Changed

- Rebalancing & activity tabs now refresh immediately after validating
  rebalancing operations.
- Improve memory management.
- Update [cosmic-lib] to 1.2.10.

### Fixed

- Fix a 0.4.4 regression which sometimes causes coin image to not display under
  activity tab.
- Fix a 0.4.4 regression which caused displayed anchor prices to be incorrect
  until first price refresh.
- Fix a bug that would cause rebalancing to fail when performed immediately
  after canceling offers - thanks [@ddombrowsy].

### Changed

- Interface loads considerably faster.
- Interface reflects account/offers change considerably faster.

## 0.4.3 - 2019-04-04

## 0.4.0 - 2019-03-21

### Changed

- Fine-tuning of offers price picking.
- Rebalance algorithm will now pass less trades and assets shares will generally
  be better balanced.
- Assets whose global market price is not known is now is now defined as its bid
  price at a depth of 50XLM (assumed liquidation price). This is intended to
  prevent over-valuation of those assets.

### Removed

- Liquidity providing feature has been removed from the rebalancing algorithm.
  This feature had a negative effect on portfolio performance in case of
  important price moves.

### Fixed

- Fix chart display when pie slice is selected.

## 0.3.0 - 2019-03-14

### Added

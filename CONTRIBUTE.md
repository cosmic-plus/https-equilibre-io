## Translations

### Improve a Translation

Translations files are in the `locales` directory.

### New Translations

1. Create a copy of the empty translation file at
   [locales/en.json](locales/en.json).
2. Name the copy after your language code (e.g: `de.json` for German translation).
3. Make sure to translate every string: partial translations will not be
   accepted.
